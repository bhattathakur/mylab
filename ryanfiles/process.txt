Step 1
-> Fit the data with gdf files
-.Chn data files
-.gdf gdf files (in gdf dir)
NOTE: also save the bgrates and rename after each run
---------------------------------------------------
Fitting Process
---------------------------------------------------
gdfit
0
file *.Chn
recall *
min
bgsave (#save the bgrates in the form bgrates.dat)
NOTE: Also rename bgrates.dat to the corresponding files
---------------------------------------------------
Result:
right gdf files which gives most of the chi-square to ~1

and convergence to 3
WARNING: No convergance in case of Co-60
---------------------------------------------------

Step 2
-> Need simulation files (in root files)
-> Convert simulated root files into data file using energy calibration in the fitted data gdf file to convert
the energy in the ROOT file back into the channels like the data gdfit fits.
->plot.py takes the simulated root file, gdf file originally used to fit the data, and outputs the chn like 
data (dat file) file which should be fitted in gdf file with new gdf files (simgdf file). 
->import ROOT worked only when thisroot.sh was sourced. It didn't work when using the other path variables
->The number of events for 0 data was just included to track how many energy are at 0. Need to set to 0 at later.
-> For fitting with gdf files ryan sent use the following steps:
=> tcsh
=> gdfit
=> 0
=> file name.Chn
=> recall name (name.gdf)
=> min
